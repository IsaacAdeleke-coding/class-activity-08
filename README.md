# Class Activity 08: Integer and Floating-Point Division

This C++ program demonstrates the difference between integer and floating-point division. The program initializes two variables, performs division, and outputs the result. The division is performed with one operand as a double, ensuring floating-point division rather than integer division.

## Program Overview

1. Two variables are declared:
   - `x` is an integer with a value of 10.
   - `y` is a double with a value of 3.
2. The program calculates the result of dividing `x` by `y` and stores it in the double variable `z`.
3. The program outputs the result of the floating-point division.

### Code Snippet

```cpp
#include

Example Output

3.33333

How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, use the following command:

g++ main.cpp -o FloatDivision
To run the compiled program, use:
./FloatDivision
Features
